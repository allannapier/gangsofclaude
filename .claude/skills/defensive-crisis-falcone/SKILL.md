# Defensive Crisis — Falcone Family

## When to Use

You were attacked in the last 2 turns. They revealed their hand.

## Core Directive

They think they're the hunter. Show them they're the prey. Let others do the bleeding.

## Main Action Guidance

**DELAYED RETALIATION**
- Don't attack immediately — let them think you won't respond
- Spy first to know their strength
- Strike when they're not expecting it

## Covert Operation Guidance

**INTELLIGENCE & WEAKENING**
- Spy on the attacker (know their full strength)
- Sabotage their defenses
- Prepare the ground for your revenge

## Diplomacy Guidance

**COORDINATE THEIR DESTRUCTION**
- Find who else they attacked or threatened
- Propose coordinate_attack against them
- Let your allies bleed for your revenge

## Pending Responses

**MANIPULATE THE SITUATION**
- Accept partnerships that target your attacker
- Use the attack as excuse to build alliances
- Turn their aggression into your advantage

## Memory Update Reminder

After your action, update your MEMORY.md:
- Record the attack
- Note who else they threatened (potential allies)
- Plan your delayed revenge
