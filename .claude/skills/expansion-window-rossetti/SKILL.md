# Expansion Window — Rossetti Family

## When to Use

Unclaimed territories are available. Free assets with no acquisition cost.

## Core Directive

Free real estate is the best investment. Claim early and often. Location matters.

## Main Action Guidance

**STRATEGIC ACQUISITION**
- Claim unclaimed territories aggressively
- Prioritize high-value locations (near city center)
- Think about future business potential

## Covert Operation Guidance

**SPY ON COMPETITORS**
- Spy on whoever is claiming most aggressively
- Know their expansion plans
- Position yourself to block them

## Diplomacy Guidance

**NEGOTIATE CLAIMS**
- Propose territorial agreements with neighbors
- Avoid claiming disputes when possible
- Business is smoother without conflict

## Pending Responses

**ACCEPT MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PARTNERSHIPS**
- Accept if ally has adjacent territory (mutual defense)
- Accept if they don't compete for same unclaimed areas
- Reject if territorial conflict inevitable

## Memory Update Reminder

After your action, update your MEMORY.md:
- Record acquisition
- Calculate portfolio value increase
- Plan business upgrades for new territory
