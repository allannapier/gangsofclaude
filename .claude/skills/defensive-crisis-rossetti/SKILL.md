# Defensive Crisis — Rossetti Family

## When to Use

You were attacked in the last 2 turns. An attack on our business.

## Core Directive

Make them regret the cost of aggression. Business is about ROI — show them this was a bad investment.

## Main Action Guidance

**CALCULATED RESPONSE**
- Fortify immediately (prevent future losses)
- Retaliate only if profitable
- Target their highest-income territory

## Covert Operation Guidance

**ECONOMIC WARFARE**
- Bribe to steal their muscle (cheap, effective)
- Sabotage their best business (reduces their income)
- Spy to find their vulnerabilities

## Diplomacy Guidance

**SEEK ALLIES AGAINST AGGRESSOR**
- Form alliance with whoever else they attacked
- Coordinate economically against them
- Shared enemies make valuable partners

## Pending Responses

**ACCEPT PROTECTIVE ALLIANCES**
- Accept partnerships that help defend against aggressor
- Reject if it would overextend you
- Calculate the defense bonus value

## Memory Update Reminder

After your action, update your MEMORY.md:
- Record the attack and your response
- Calculate the cost to the attacker
- Update threat assessment

## Output Format
